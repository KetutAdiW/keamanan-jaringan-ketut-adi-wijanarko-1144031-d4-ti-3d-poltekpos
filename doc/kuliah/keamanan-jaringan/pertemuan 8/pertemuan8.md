Understanding Firewall is a computer network security system used to protect computers from some types of computer attacks from the outside.
Understanding Firewalls are intended above is a system or device that authorize computer network traffic that is considered safe for through and prevention terhadapa networks that are considered unsafe. Fire-wall can be either software (computer program or application) or hardware (special equipment to run the program fire-wall) device that filters network traffic between networks. Firewall protection is required for computing devices such as computer enabled with Internet connection. Increasing the level of computer network security by providing detailed information on patterns of network traffic. This device is an important and indispensable because it acts as a security gateway between the internal computer network and external computer networks.
Generally Firewalls are used to control access to anyone who has access to the private network from outside parties. At present, the firewall sense understood by the generic term that refers to the firewall function as a regulator of the system of communication between two different networks. Given that many companies now have access to the Internet, the protection of digital assets of the company from attack by hackers, espionage offenders, thieves or other data, so that the fire-wall functionality into a very essential thing. "
function Firewall
Before understanding the firewall function lets understand it attributes importance as follows:
All network communications pass through fire wall
Only authorized traffic is allowed by a fire wall
Having the ability to withstand Internet attacks
Firewall functions as a controller, monitor the flow of data packets flowing through a network. Firewall function set, filter and control the data traffic that is allowed to access the protected private network, some of the criteria that made fire-wall whether to allow data packets passed or not, among other things:
The IP address of the source computer
Port TCP / UDP source of resources.
The IP address of the destination computer.
Port TCP / UDP destination data on the destination computer
Information from the header that is stored in the data packet.
Firewall functions do authentication to access a network. Fire-wall application proxy is able to examine more than just the header of the data packets, this capability demanded to reliably detect the specific applicationbenefits Firewall
Benefits firewall to keep confidential and valuable information that slipped out without the knowledge. For example, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) traffic on a computer network organizations controlled by the fire-wall. This is done to prevent users on the network to send confidential files intentional or unintentionally to other parties.
Benefits Firewall as a filter is also used to prevent certain traffic flowing into the network subnet. This prevents users share files, and play around in jaringan.Aplikasi this type are useful, especially in the corporate sector.
Benefits other firewall is to modify the data packets arrive at the fire-wall. This process is called Network Address Translation (NAT). No NAT NAT type is called the base, where the IP address (Internet Protocol) network of personal computers hidden behind a particular IP address. This process is referred to as IP guises. This helps the user in a network that includes the system without a number of public IP address, to access the Internet.
Accuracy of data such as financial information, product specifications, product prices, etc., are very important for any business development. If the information is changed by an external source, it will have an impact here is merugikan.Manfaat Firewall prevents unauthorized data modification in the website.
If the system is not available to users in a timely manner, then halini will lead to decreased employee productivity, loss of consumer confidence, and bad publicity. Fire-wall ensures system availability.
How Firewalls Work
Computer has thousands of ports that can be accessed for a variety of purposes. How Firewalls Work on the computer is shut down ports except for some specific ports that need to be kept open. Firewall on a computer acting as a line of defense in preventing all kinds of hacking into the network, because, every hacker trying to break into the computer network will look for open ports that can be accessed.
Firewall technology is now very sophisticated. Previously, the workings of a firewall to filter network traffic using IP address, port number, and protocol, but this time the fire-wall can filter the data by identifying the message content itself. With the help of fire-wall, sensitive or inappropriate information can be prevented through
