Remote Access (in some literature Authentication) Dial-In User Service, which is often shortened to RADIUS, is a computer security protocol used for authentication, authorization, and centralized user account registration to access the network. RADIUS is defined in RFC 2865 and RFC 2866, which was originally used to authenticate the remote network access (remote) by using a dial-up connection.



RADIUS has now been implemented to authenticate the network access remotely using a connection other than dial-up, as well as Virtual Private Networking (VPN), wireless access point, Ethernet switches, and other devices.
