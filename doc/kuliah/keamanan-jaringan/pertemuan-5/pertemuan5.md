Spoofing is a "technique used to gain unauthorized access to a computer or information, which an attacker associated with the user by pretending to falsify that they are hosts to be believed" this is usually done by a hacker / cracker.

Macam-Macam Spoofing
IP-Spoofing is a complex technical attack yant consists of several components. It is a security exploit that works by tricking computers in a trust relationship that you are someone else. There are many papers written by daemon9, route, and infinity in the Volume Seven, Issue fourty-Eight Phrack magazine.
DNS spoofing is taking the DNS name of another system with a domain name server jeopardize a legitimate domain.
Identify Spoofing is an act of intrusion by using official identity illegally. By using this identity, the intruder will be able to access anything on the network.

Examples of Web Spoofing
Web Spoofing involves a web server that is owned by an attacker who is put on the Internet between users with WWW, so access to the webpage that the user is going through a server the attacker. This way is known as the "man in the middle attack" [2,5]. This can occur with some roads, but most likely are:
Access to the website is routed through a proxy server: this is called (HTTP) application proxy. This provides better network management access to the server. This is a pretty good technique that is used on many websites on the internet, but this technique does not prevent site spoofing.
Someone put a false link (which is already hacked) on popular web pages.
We use search engines (search engines, such as Yahoo, Alta Vista, Goggle) to get a link from the topics you want to search. Without our knowledge, some of these links have been placed by a hacker who pretend to be someone else. Such as, the search for the bank's website provides one of the results http: //www.kilkbca..com, unfortunately we may not know that the actual URL of Bank BCA is http://www.klikbca.com
We use a browser to access the Web. Everything on the NET (either Internet or Intranet) referenced by the Universal Resource Locator (URL). First the attacker must rewrite the URL of the destination web page so that they refer to a server owned by the attacker rather than to the actual web server. For example, the server is located in www.attacker.com attacker, the attacker will rewrite the URL by adding http://www.attacker.com front 
How to Do Spoofing
There are many ways of doing spoofing both the tool and the user, including:
1. TOR
TOR is an open source project created in 2001 and are still being developed to use a concept called sekarang.tor sebagaionion proxy by which data is sent the place of destination is going through some proxy different each time randomly selected. I use it quite easy, just start the program and then wait a moment will appear innate tor firefox then please check the ip address the ip addresses are tersamarkan.bila want to have this tool please download on his official website that http://www.torproject.org/download/ download-easy.html.en
2. Proxy Switcher
to use this tool first time click the download server, and then click 2x on the proxy that we want to use the automatic setting dibrowser we will turn it into a proxy that we select before, only this program is licensed alias paid but many also spread crack for this program ,
3. Anonymouse.org
Anonymouse is not a program but a website that offers IP masquerade us.We just enter the website address to be visited and anonymouse.org will open the website through a proxy that they kelola.bila want to try to directly to the website is http: //anonymouse.urg/
How Prevention of IP Spoofing
· Install Filter in Router by utilizing the "ingress and egress filtering" on the router is the first step in defending themselves from spoofing. We can use the ACL (access control list) to block a private IP address on the network for downstream
· Encryption and Authentifikasikita should eliminate all host-based authentication, which is in use on a computer with the same subnet
There are some precautionary steps that we can lakuakan to limit the risk of IP spoofing in the network, among other things:
Installing Filter Router - by utilizing the "ingress and egress filtering" on the router is the first step in defending themselves from spoofing. We can use the ACL (access control list) to block a private IP address on the network for downstream. Done by configuring the routers in order to restrain the packages that come with the source address of packets that are not legal (illegitimate).
This technique requires a router with sufficient resources to check the source address of each packet and have knowledge that is large enough to be able to distinguish between the legal address and which are not.
Encryption and Authentication - we can also overcome IP spoofing by implementing the authentication and data encryption. Both these features are already in use on IPv6. Furthermore, we should eliminate all host-based authentication, which is in use on a computer with the same subnet.
Make sure the authentication is done on a secure path in this case the path that has been encrypted.
1. Use-based authentication key exchange between computers in a network, such as IPsec will reduce the risk of spoofing diseased tissue.
2. Use access control lists to deny the private IP address in downsteram interface.
3. Use a filter on the inbound and outbound flow.
4. Configuring the router and switch in such a way so as to deny the packet from the outside network that claims to be a package that comes from within the network.
5. Enable encryption sessions at the router so that the trusted host that originated from outside your network can communicate securely to your local host.
Spoofing attacks carried out by hackers
Spoofing is often used by hackers to launch attacks as below.

A. SMURAF Attack
Is a broadcast ping is sent and the source IP looks the same as the victim's IP address. The computer will respond back and sent and will meirim Ping Reply to the victim. This happens continuously, until the victim's machine or link will overload causing a Denial of Service.
B. TCP sequence number prediction
A TCP connection is marked with a sequence number for the client and server, if the sequence number can be guessed that the hecker can easily forged IP address.

C. DNS poisoning through sequence prediction
DNS servers typically query other DNS servers to find out the name of another host. Hackers send recquest to the target DNS server, as well as a response to the same server
